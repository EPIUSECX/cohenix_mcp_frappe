# Model Context Profile: `locale`

## 1. Module Overview

The `locale` module is not a functional module containing Python logic. It is the designated directory within the `frappe` app for storing its own translation source files.

The directory contains a collection of `.po` files, each corresponding to a specific language (e.g., `de.po` for German, `es.po` for Spanish), and a `main.pot` file, which is the master template containing all extractable strings from the Frappe framework's source code.

The logic for creating, updating, and compiling these files resides entirely within the `frappe.gettext` module.

## 2. File Index

-   **`main.pot`**: The Portable Object Template file for the `frappe` app. It contains all the translatable strings extracted from the framework's source code.
-   **`*.po`**: A series of Portable Object files, one for each language. These files contain the original strings from the `.pot` file and their corresponding translations for that specific language.

## 3. Public API / Callable Functions

This module does not contain any callable functions or a public API.

## 4. Detailed Walkthrough

As this is a content-only module, there are no code files to analyze. Its purpose is to serve as the storage location for the Frappe framework's translation files, which are managed by the `frappe.gettext` module.
