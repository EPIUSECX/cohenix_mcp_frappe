# Model Context Profile: `change_log`

## 1. Module Overview

The `change_log` module is not a functional module containing Python logic. Instead, it serves as a repository for storing Markdown-based release notes for different versions of the Frappe Framework.

The directories within this module (`v5`, `v6`, `v10`, etc.) correspond to major framework versions, and they contain `.md` files detailing the changes for that release. The `current` directory is a placeholder for upcoming release notes.

The actual logic for tracking document changes and creating versions is handled by the **`Version`** DocType, which is located in the `frappe/core/doctype/version` directory.

## 2. File Index

-   **`__init__.py`**: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python module.
-   **`v*` directories**: Contain changelog files for past Frappe versions.
-   **`current/`**: A directory to place changelog files for the next release.

## 3. Public API / Callable Functions

This module does not contain any callable functions or a public API.

## 4. Detailed Walkthrough

As this is a content-only module, there are no code files to analyze. The primary takeaway is that this module's purpose is for release documentation, and the programmatic logic for versioning exists within `frappe.core`.
