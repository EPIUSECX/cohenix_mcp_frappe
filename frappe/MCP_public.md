# Model Context Profile: `public`

## 1. Module Overview

The `public` module in a Frappe app serves as the directory for web-accessible assets. Unlike the assets in `assets/` which are processed by the build system, files in the `public` directory are typically served directly by the web server.

This module is expected to contain:
-   Static JavaScript files (`js/`).
-   Static CSS files (`css/`).
-   Images and other media.
-   The compiled output of the build system (`dist/`).

This module generally does not contain Python logic, but rather the static assets that form the front-end of the Desk and Website.

## 2. File Index

The `public` module contains several subdirectories for organizing static assets:

-   **`css/`**: Contains raw CSS files that are included in the Desk and web pages.
-   **`js/`**: Contains raw JavaScript files and libraries.
-   **`scss/`**: Contains SCSS source files which are compiled into CSS during the build process.
-   **`images/`**: Contains static images like logos and placeholders.
-   **`icons/`**: Contains various icon sets used throughout the UI.
-   **`html/`**: Contains static HTML partials or templates.
-   **`sounds/`**: Contains sound files for notifications.

## 3. Public API / Callable Functions

This module does not contain any callable Python functions. Its "API" is the set of URLs that map to the static files it contains, which are referenced in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 4. Detailed Walkthrough

As this is a content-only module for static web assets, there are no code files to analyze. The key concept is that this directory is the designated location for all publicly accessible, static files that are part of the Frappe framework's user interface. These files are either served directly by the web server or processed by the build system (`frappe.build`) and included in the final compiled assets (`dist/` folder, which is not version controlled).
