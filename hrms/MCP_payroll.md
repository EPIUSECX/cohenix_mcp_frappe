### **Module: `Payroll`**

**1. High-Level Summary:**

*   **Purpose:** The Payroll module is responsible for managing all aspects of employee compensation. It automates the process of calculating salaries, handling deductions, and processing payments. It integrates tightly with the HR module to fetch employee details, leave information, and expense claims, ensuring accurate and timely payroll processing.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Salary Structure and Component Management
    *   Automated Salary Slip Generation
    *   Loan Management and Repayment Tracking
    *   Tax Calculation and Deduction
    *   Employee Benefit and Perk Management
    *   Payroll Period and Frequency Configuration

**2. Core Components (DocTypes):**

*   **DocType: `Salary Slip`**
    *   **Type:** Submittable Document
    *   **Purpose:** This is the central document in the payroll process. It represents an individual employee's salary calculation for a specific period. It details all earnings (basic, allowances) and deductions (taxes, loans), arriving at the final net pay. It can be generated individually or in bulk via a `Payroll Entry`.
    *   **Key Fields:**
| Field Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `employee` | Link | The employee for whom the salary slip is generated. |
| `salary_structure` | Link | The salary structure used for the calculation. |
| `start_date` | Date | The start date of the payroll period. |
| `end_date` | Date | The end date of the payroll period. |
| `payment_days` | Float | The number of days for which the employee is being paid. |
| `gross_pay` | Currency | The total of all earnings before any deductions. |
| `total_deduction` | Currency | The total of all deductions. |
| `net_pay` | Currency | The final take-home salary (Gross Pay - Total Deduction). |
| `status` | Select | The status of the salary slip (Draft, Submitted, Cancelled, Withheld). |

    *   **Backend Logic (`salary_slip.py`):**
        *   **Controller Class Methods:**
            *   `validate`: A master validation method that triggers a cascade of other methods to fetch employee details, calculate working days, pull components from the salary structure, and compute the final net pay.
            *   `on_submit`: Finalizes the salary slip, makes loan repayment entries, and can trigger an email to the employee with their salary slip PDF.
            *   `on_cancel`: Reverses loan repayments and updates the status.
            *   `get_emp_and_working_day_details`: The core method that orchestrates fetching the salary structure, leave details, and calculating payment days based on attendance or leave records.
            *   `calculate_net_pay`: Evaluates all the formulas and conditions in the attached salary structure to compute the amounts for each earning and deduction component.
            *   `calculate_variable_based_on_taxable_salary`: Calculates income tax based on the employee's taxable earnings and the applicable tax slab.
        *   **Standard Hooks:**
            *   The document follows a standard `validate` -> `on_submit` -> `on_cancel` lifecycle, with each step containing significant business logic.
        *   **Whitelisted API Methods (`@frappe.whitelist()`):**
            *   `get_emp_and_working_day_details`: Can be called from the client-side to pull the latest salary structure details into the form.
            *   `process_salary_based_on_working_days`: Recalculates the salary slip based on manually adjusted Leave Without Pay (LWP) days.
    *   **Frontend Logic (`salary_slip.js`):**
        *   **Client Scripts (`frm.cscript`):**
            *   `employee`: When an employee is selected, it triggers the `get_emp_and_working_day_details` method to populate the salary slip with the relevant salary structure and components.
            *   `start_date`, `end_date`: Changing the dates re-triggers the fetching of employee and working day details.
            *   `leave_without_pay`: Manually changing the LWP days triggers a server call to recalculate the entire salary slip.
        *   **Custom Button Actions:** No custom buttons are added by default, but the standard "Submit" and "Cancel" buttons drive the core process.
    *   **Workflow:** The document is `Submittable`. The `status` field (Draft, Submitted, Cancelled, Withheld) tracks its state. It is typically generated and submitted via a `Payroll Entry` document for bulk processing.

*   **DocType: `Salary Structure`**
    *   **Type:** Submittable Document
    *   **Purpose:** This DocType acts as a template for creating `Salary Slips`. It defines the earnings and deductions applicable to an employee or a group of employees. It is highly flexible, allowing for formula-based calculations, and can be configured for different payroll frequencies (monthly, weekly, etc.).
    *   **Key Fields:**
| Field Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `is_active` | Select | Determines if the salary structure can be used for creating new salary slips. |
| `company` | Link | The company for which this salary structure is applicable. |
| `payroll_frequency` | Select | The frequency at which salaries are processed (e.g., Monthly, Weekly). |
| `earnings` | Table | A child table listing all the earning components (e.g., Basic, HRA). |
| `deductions` | Table | A child table listing all the deduction components (e.g., Income Tax, Provident Fund). |
| `salary_slip_based_on_timesheet` | Check | If checked, salaries are calculated based on hourly rates and timesheet data. |

    *   **Backend Logic (`salary_structure.py`):**
        *   **Controller Class Methods:**
            *   `validate`: Ensures that the structure is configured correctly, validating formulas, flexible benefit amounts, and other settings.
            *   `assign_salary_structure`: A whitelisted method that allows for bulk assignment of the salary structure to multiple employees based on criteria like department, designation, etc.
            *   `get_employees`: A utility method to fetch a list of employees who are assigned this salary structure.
        *   **Standard Hooks:**
            *   The document is `Submittable`, meaning it can be finalized to prevent further changes.
        *   **Whitelisted API Methods (`@frappe.whitelist()`):**
            *   `make_salary_slip`: The core function that generates a `Salary Slip` document based on this structure for a given employee. This is used for previewing salary slips.
            *   `get_employees`: Retrieves a list of employees assigned to this structure, primarily used for the preview functionality.
    *   **Frontend Logic (`salary_structure.js`):**
        *   **Client Scripts (`frm.cscript`):**
            *   `refresh`: Adds custom buttons for "Single Assignment", "Bulk Assignments", and "Preview Salary Slip".
            *   `preview_salary_slip`: A client-side script that calls the `make_salary_slip` backend method to generate a preview of a salary slip for a selected employee.
            *   `salary_component` (in child table): When a salary component is selected in the earnings or deductions table, it fetches the default values (formula, condition, etc.) from the `Salary Component` master.
        *   **Custom Button Actions:**
            *   **Single/Bulk Assignments:** Provides a user-friendly way to assign the salary structure to one or many employees at once.
            *   **Preview Salary Slip:** Allows the user to see a sample salary slip for any employee assigned to the structure, which is useful for verification and testing.
    *   **Workflow:** The document is `Submittable`. Once submitted, it is considered active and can be used in payroll. It can be amended to create a new version if changes are needed.

**3. Reports & Pages:**

*   **Component: `Salary Register`**
    *   **Type:** Report
    *   **Purpose:** This report provides a consolidated summary of all salary slips for a given period. It's a crucial tool for auditing payroll, reviewing salary components across the company, and generating financial summaries. The report is highly customizable, allowing users to filter by various parameters like company, department, and date range.
    *   **Data Source:** This is a Script Report that fetches data primarily from the `Salary Slip` and `Salary Detail` DocTypes.
    *   **Backend Logic (`salary_register.py`):**
        *   The `execute` function is the main entry point. It first retrieves all `Salary Slip` records based on the filters provided by the user.
        *   It then dynamically determines all unique earning and deduction components present in those salary slips to create the report columns.
        *   It queries the `Salary Detail` DocType to get the amounts for each component for each salary slip and pivots this data to populate the dynamic columns.
        *   The script also fetches additional employee details like date of joining to provide a comprehensive view.
    *   **Frontend Logic (`salary_register.js`):**
        *   This file defines the filters that are available to the user on the report page.
        *   The filters include `From Date`, `To Date`, `Company`, `Employee`, `Department`, `Designation`, and `Branch`, allowing for granular control over the data displayed in the report.

**4. Module-Level Logic & APIs:**

*   **Public API (`api.py` or whitelisted methods):** The `payroll` module does not have a dedicated `api.py` file. Public methods are exposed as whitelisted functions within the DocType controllers themselves (e.g., `get_emp_and_working_day_details` in `Salary Slip`).
*   **Scheduled Jobs (`hooks.py`):** The `scheduler_events` in the `hooks.py` file do not contain any entries that are specific to the `payroll` module. Payroll processing is typically initiated manually through the `Payroll Entry` DocType.
*   **Other Hooks (`hooks.py`):**
    *   **`doc_events`**: The `payroll` module hooks into the `on_cancel` event of `Journal Entry` to unlink any related salary slips (`hrms.payroll.doctype.salary_slip.salary_slip.unlink_ref_doc_from_salary_slip`). This ensures data integrity when accounting entries are reversed.
    *   **`period_closing_doctypes`**: The `Payroll Entry` DocType is registered as a period-closing document, which means it is subject to the period-closing rules in the Accounts module.

**5. Inter-Module Dependencies & Extensibility:**

*   **Consumes (Dependencies):**
    *   **HR Module:** The `payroll` module is fundamentally dependent on the `hr` module. It fetches employee details, leave records (`Leave Without Pay`), and other HR data to process salaries.
    *   **Accounts Module:** The payroll process is tightly integrated with accounting. `Salary Slip` submissions can generate `Journal Entries` to book liabilities and expenses.
    *   **ERPNext:** The module relies on the core ERPNext application for functionalities like `Company` and `Accounts Settings`.
*   **Exposes (API Surface for Extension):**
    *   The primary way to interact with the `payroll` module is through its DocTypes. Creating a `Salary Structure` and then a `Payroll Entry` is the standard way to run the payroll process.
    *   The whitelisted methods in the `Salary Slip` controller provide a way to programmatically fetch payroll data and trigger calculations.
    *   The `doc_events` for `Journal Entry` provide an extension point. A custom app could hook into these events to perform additional actions when payroll-related accounting entries are made or cancelled.
