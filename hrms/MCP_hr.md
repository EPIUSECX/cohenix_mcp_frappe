### **Module: `HR`**

**1. High-Level Summary:**

*   **Purpose:** The HR (Human Resources) module forms the core of the personnel management system within the Frappe HR application. It is responsible for managing the entire employee lifecycle, from recruitment and onboarding to attendance, leave, performance, and eventual separation. The module provides a comprehensive set of tools to maintain detailed employee records, manage organizational structure (departments, designations), and handle day-to-day HR operations.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Employee Information Management
    *   Recruitment (Job Openings, Job Applicants, Interviews)
    *   Onboarding and Offboarding
    *   Attendance and Leave Management
    *   Expense Claims
    *   Performance Appraisals
    *   Employee Training and Development
    *   Shift and Roster Management
    *   Employee Grievance Handling

**2. Core Components (DocTypes):**

*   **DocType: `Employee`**
    *   **Type:** Document (Tree)
    *   **Purpose:** This DocType is the central repository for all information related to an employee. It stores personal details, company and employment information, contact details, salary information, and tracks their history within the organization. As a tree-structured DocType, it can be used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as reporting lines.
    *   **Key Fields:**
| Field Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `employee_name` | Data | The full name of the employee. |
| `status` | Select | The current employment status (e.g., Active, Inactive, Left). |
| `company` | Link | The company the employee belongs to. |
| `designation` | Link | The employee's job title or position. |
| `department` | Link | The department the employee is assigned to. |
| `date_of_joining` | Date | The date the employee started their employment. |
| `user_id` | Link | The system User account associated with the employee. |
| `reports_to` | Link | The employee's direct manager or supervisor. |

    *   **Backend Logic (`erpnext/setup/doctype/employee/employee.py` & `hrms/overrides/employee_master.py`):**
        *   **Controller Class Methods:**
            *   `autoname`: Overridden in `EmployeeMaster` to set the document name based on HR Settings (Naming Series, Employee Number, or Full Name).
        *   **Standard Hooks:**
            *   `validate`: The `validate_onboarding_process` function is called to check for an associated "Employee Onboarding" document and validate the employee creation against it.
            *   `on_update`: Calls `update_approver_role` to assign "Leave Approver" and "Expense Approver" roles to the specified approvers. Also calls `publish_update` for real-time updates.
            *   `after_insert`: The `update_job_applicant_and_offer` function is triggered to update the status of the linked "Job Applicant" and "Job Offer" to "Accepted".
            *   `on_trash`: The `update_employee_transfer` function is called to clear the `new_employee_id` from any "Employee Transfer" record if the employee document is deleted.
        *   **Whitelisted API Methods (`@frappe.whitelist()`):**
            *   `get_timeline_data`: Retrieves attendance data for the employee's timeline view. Takes `doctype` and `name` as parameters.
            *   `get_retirement_date`: Calculates the employee's retirement date based on their date of birth and the retirement age specified in HR Settings. Takes `date_of_birth` as a parameter.
    *   **Frontend Logic (`[Not Found]`):**
        *   The file `hrms/public/js/erpnext/employee.js` was specified in `hooks.py` but could not be located in the provided file system. It is likely that this file contains client-side customizations for the Employee form.
    *   **Workflow:** No specific workflow is attached to the Employee DocType by default, but its status field (`Active`, `Inactive`, `Suspended`, `Left`) drives many downstream processes.

---
*   **DocType: `Leave Application`**
    *   **Type:** Submittable Document
    *   **Purpose:** This DocType is used by employees to formally request time off from work. It captures the leave type, duration, and reason for the absence. The document goes through an approval process, and upon submission, it updates leave balances and can automatically mark attendance records.
    *   **Key Fields:**
| Field Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `employee` | Link | The employee applying for the leave. |
| `leave_type` | Link | The type of leave being requested (e.g., Sick Leave, Casual Leave). |
| `from_date` | Date | The start date of the leave period. |
| `to_date` | Date | The end date of the leave period. |
| `total_leave_days` | Float | The calculated number of leave days, excluding holidays if configured. |
| `leave_approver` | Link | The user responsible for approving the leave request. |
| `status` | Select | The current status of the application (Open, Approved, Rejected, Cancelled). |

    *   **Backend Logic (`leave_application.py`):**
        *   **Controller Class Methods:**
            *   `validate`: Performs a comprehensive set of validations, including checking for overlapping leave applications, ensuring sufficient leave balance, validating against block dates, and checking for already marked attendance.
            *   `on_submit`: Updates attendance records to "On Leave" or "Half Day" for the leave period. It also creates the corresponding `Leave Ledger Entry` to debit the leave balance.
            *   `on_cancel`: Reverses the `Leave Ledger Entry` and cancels any attendance records that were created upon submission.
            *   `notify_employee` & `notify_leave_approver`: Sends email notifications based on templates defined in HR Settings.
        *   **Standard Hooks:**
            *   `validate`: Calls multiple validation methods to ensure the integrity of the leave application before it is saved.
            *   `on_update`: Triggers notifications and shares the document with the approver.
        *   **Whitelisted API Methods (`@frappe.whitelist()`):**
            *   `get_number_of_leave_days`: A utility function to calculate the actual number of leave days between two dates, considering holidays and half-day options.
            *   `get_leave_balance_on`: Retrieves the available leave balance for a specific employee and leave type on a given date.
            *   `get_leave_details`: Fetches a summary of all leave allocations, balances, and pending leaves for an employee.
            *   `get_leave_approver`: Fetches the default leave approver for an employee.
    *   **Frontend Logic (`leave_application.js`):**
        *   **Client Scripts (`frm.cscript`):**
            *   `onload`: Sets the posting date and checks if a leave approver is mandatory.
            *   `employee`: Fetches and displays the employee's leave balance dashboard, and sets the default leave approver.
            *   `from_date`, `to_date`, `half_day`: Dynamically recalculates the `total_leave_days` whenever the dates or half-day option changes by calling the `get_number_of_leave_days` backend method.
            *   `make_dashboard`: Renders a custom dashboard section showing the employee's current leave balances for all allocated leave types.
        *   **Custom Button Actions:**
            *   A "View Ledger" button is added to the form to allow users to quickly navigate to the `Leave Ledger Entry` list for the selected employee.
    *   **Workflow:** While no workflow is attached by default, the `status` field (Open, Approved, Rejected) and the `is_submittable` property imply a standard approval process. The system can be configured to enforce a workflow for approvals.

---
*   **DocType: `Expense Claim`**
    *   **Type:** Submittable Document
    *   **Purpose:** This DocType allows employees to claim reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of the company. It facilitates the entire process from drafting the claim, adding expense details, attaching proofs, submitting for approval, and finally, processing the payment. It also handles linking claims to employee advances.
    *   **Key Fields:**
| Field Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `employee` | Link | The employee submitting the expense claim. |
| `approval_status` | Select | The current approval status of the claim (Draft, Approved, Rejected). |
| `total_claimed_amount` | Currency | The total amount of all expenses claimed by the employee. |
| `total_sanctioned_amount` | Currency | The total amount approved by the expense approver. |
| `grand_total` | Currency | The final amount to be reimbursed after considering advances and taxes. |
| `is_paid` | Check | A flag indicating whether the expense claim has been paid. |
| `payable_account` | Link | The company's liability account from which the expense will be paid. |

    *   **Backend Logic (`expense_claim.py`):**
        *   **Controller Class Methods:**
            *   `validate`: Calculates total amounts, validates against employee advances, and sets the appropriate status.
            *   `on_submit`: Creates General Ledger entries to book the expense against the company's accounts. It also updates the claimed amount in any linked `Employee Advance` documents.
            *   `on_cancel`: Reverses the General Ledger entries and updates the linked `Employee Advance` documents accordingly.
            *   `make_gl_entries`: A core method that constructs and posts the accounting entries for the expense claim, debiting the expense accounts and crediting the payable account.
        *   **Standard Hooks:**
            *   `on_update`: Shares the document with the specified `expense_approver`.
        *   **Whitelisted API Methods (`@frappe.whitelist()`):**
            *   `get_expense_claim_account`: Fetches the default expense account for a given `Expense Claim Type` and company.
            *   `get_advances`: Retrieves a list of open `Employee Advance` documents for a given employee that can be linked to the claim.
            *   `make_bank_entry`: A utility function to create a `Journal Entry` to record the payment against the expense claim.
    *   **Frontend Logic (`expense_claim.js`):**
        *   **Client Scripts (`frm.cscript`):**
            *   `onload`: Sets up various query filters for link fields and checks if an `expense_approver` is mandatory.
            *   `refresh`: Adds custom buttons like "Payment" (to create a `Payment Entry`) and "Accounting Ledger" (to view the GL entries).
            *   `employee`: Automatically fetches any open advances for the selected employee.
            *   `expenses` (Table): When an `expense_type` is selected in a row, it fetches the corresponding default expense account. When the `amount` is changed, it automatically sets the `sanctioned_amount` to the same value.
        *   **Custom Button Actions:**
            *   **Payment:** Creates a `Payment Entry` or `Journal Entry` to record the reimbursement to the employee.
            *   **Accounting Ledger:** Provides a shortcut to view the `General Ledger` report filtered for the current expense claim.
    *   **Workflow:** The `approval_status` field (Draft, Approved, Rejected) combined with the submittable nature of the DocType enforces a clear approval workflow. An expense claim must be `Approved` before it can be paid.

**3. Reports & Pages:**

*   **Component: `Employee Information`**
    *   **Type:** Report
    *   **Purpose:** This report provides a comprehensive, list-based view of all employees in the system. It serves as a central directory for accessing key employee data.
    *   **Data Source:** The report is built using the "Report Builder" and directly fetches data from the `Employee` DocType. The columns displayed are configured in the report's JSON definition and include fields like Employee Number, Date of Joining, Department, Designation, and Status.
    *   **Backend Logic:** As a standard Report Builder report, there is no custom backend Python logic. The Frappe framework handles the data fetching and filtering based on the report's configuration.
    *   **Frontend Logic:** There is no custom JavaScript file. User interactions, such as filtering and sorting, are handled by the standard Report Builder UI.

---
**4. Module-Level Logic & APIs:**

*   **Public API (`api.py` or whitelisted methods):** The `hr` module does not have a dedicated `api.py` file. Public methods are exposed as whitelisted functions within the DocType controllers themselves (e.g., `get_leave_balance_on` in `Leave Application`).
*   **Scheduled Jobs (`hooks.py`):**
    *   **`all`**: `hrms.hr.doctype.interview.interview.send_interview_reminder` - Sends reminders for upcoming interviews.
    *   **`hourly`**: `hrms.hr.doctype.daily_work_summary_group.daily_work_summary_group.trigger_emails` - Triggers email notifications for daily work summaries.
    *   **`hourly_long`**: Includes jobs for processing auto-attendance and shift creation (`process_auto_attendance_for_all_shifts`, `process_auto_shift_creation`).
    *   **`daily`**: A variety of daily tasks are scheduled, including sending birthday/anniversary reminders, sending daily work summaries, and closing expired job openings.
    *   **`daily_long`**: Processes expired leave allocations and allocates earned leaves.
*   **Other Hooks (`hooks.py`):**
    *   **`doc_events`**: The `hr` module defines numerous document events. For example, it hooks into the `on_submit` and `on_cancel` events of `Payment Entry` and `Journal Entry` to update the status of linked `Expense Claims`. It also has extensive hooks for the `Employee` DocType to manage the onboarding process and update user roles.
    *   **`override_doctype_class`**: The module overrides the standard `Employee` and `Timesheet` DocTypes with custom classes (`EmployeeMaster`, `EmployeeTimesheet`) to inject specialized HRMS logic.

**5. Inter-Module Dependencies & Extensibility:**

*   **Consumes (Dependencies):**
    *   **ERPNext:** The entire HRMS application has a hard dependency on ERPNext, as declared in the `required_apps` hook. It inherits and extends core DocTypes like `Employee`, `Company`, and `Project`.
    *   **Accounts Module:** The `Expense Claim` functionality is tightly coupled with the Accounts module. It creates `Journal Entry` records and interacts with `Payment Entry` for reimbursements.
    *   **Core Frappe Framework:** Relies heavily on core Frappe features like whitelisted methods for APIs, scheduled jobs for automation, and DocType events for business logic.
*   **Exposes (API Surface for Extension):**
    *   The primary way to interact with the `hr` module is through its DocTypes. Creating a `Leave Application` or `Expense Claim` record will trigger the module's internal logic.
    *   Whitelisted methods within the DocTypes (e.g., `get_leave_balance_on`) provide a direct way to query HR data.
    *   The `doc_events` defined in `hooks.py` for core ERPNext DocTypes (like `Payment Entry`) provide extension points. For example, a custom app could also hook into the `on_submit` of a `Payment Entry` to perform additional actions.

**6. File Manifest:**

*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hr/doctype/employee/employee.json` (Inherited from ERPNext: `erpnext-develop/erpnext/setup/doctype/employee/employee.json`)
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/overrides/employee_master.py`
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hr/doctype/leave_application/leave_application.json`
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hr/doctype/leave_application/leave_application.py`
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hr/doctype/leave_application/leave_application.js`
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hr/doctype/expense_claim/expense_claim.json`
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hr/doctype/expense_claim/expense_claim.py`
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hr/doctype/expense_claim/expense_claim.js`
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hr/report/employee_information/employee_information.json`
*   `hrms-develop/hrms/hooks.py`
