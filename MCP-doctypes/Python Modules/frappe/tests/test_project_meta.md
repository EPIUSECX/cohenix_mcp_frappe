## Classes

### `TestProjectMeta`
**Inherits:** `IntegrationTestCase`


**Docstring:**
```

```

**Methods:**
| Name | Arguments | Decorators | Docstring |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_init_py_tax_paid` | `self` | `` | Impose the __init__.py tax.

frappe/__init__.py has grown crazy big and keeps getting bigger. Plot the LOC over time and
you'll see the madness and laziness in action.

This new ~test~ tax will require reducing 3 line per day (~1000 in a year) from 1st Jan
2025 onwards. I am offering a headstart of 50 days in this PR: #28869

Don't try to delete or bypass this. |
