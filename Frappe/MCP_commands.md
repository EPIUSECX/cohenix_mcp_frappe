# Model Context Profile: `commands`

## 1. Module Overview

The `commands` module is responsible for defining and executing the command-line interface (CLI) for the Frappe Framework, which is accessed via the `bench` command. This module provides the structure for adding new commands, parsing arguments, and executing the corresponding Python functions.

Key functionalities are expected to include:
-   The core logic for the `bench` command-line tool.
-   Implementations for built-in commands like `bench start`, `bench update`, `bench migrate`, etc.
-   A mechanism for apps to extend `bench` with their own custom commands.

## 2. File Index

-   **`__init__.py`**: The entry point that aggregates all command definitions from other files in the module using the `click` library.
-   **`site.py`**: Contains all commands related to site management, such as creating, restoring, backing up, migrating, and dropping sites.
-   **`scheduler.py`**: Contains commands for controlling and interacting with the background job scheduler and workers.
-   **`utils.py`**: Provides a wide range of utility commands for development and administration, including building assets, clearing caches, data import/export, and running the development server.
-   **`gettext.py`**, **`translate.py`**: Contain commands related to language translation management.
-   **`testing.py`**, **`test_commands.py`**: Contain commands for running the Frappe test suite.
-   **`redis_utils.py`**: Contains commands for interacting with Redis.

## 3. Public API / Callable Functions

The "public API" of this module is the set of command-line functions it exposes through the `bench` executable. These are not typically called from Python code but are the primary interface for developers and system administrators to manage a Frappe instance.

**Key Commands:**

-   `bench new-site {site_name}`: Creates a new site.
-   `bench --site {site_name} migrate`: Runs database schema migrations and syncs apps.
-   `bench --site {site_name} backup`: Creates a backup of the site's database and files.
-   `bench --site {site_name} restore {path_to_sql_file}`: Restores a site from a backup.
-   `bench --site {site_name} install-app {app_name}`: Installs an app to a site.
-   `bench --site {site_name} uninstall-app {app_name}`: Uninstalls an app from a site.
-   `bench start`: Starts the development server and other processes.
-   `bench build`: Compiles front-end assets (JS/CSS).
-   `bench watch`: Watches for file changes and automatically rebuilds assets.
-   `bench --site {site_name} console`: Starts an interactive Python (IPython) shell with the site context loaded.
-   `bench scheduler [enable|disable|pause|resume]`: Manages the background job scheduler.

## 4. Detailed Walkthrough

### `__init__.py`

This file is the heart of the command registration system. It uses the `click` library, a popular Python package for creating command-line interfaces.

-   **`get_commands()`**: This function is the central aggregator. It imports the `commands` list (a list of `click.Command` objects) from each specialized file (`site.py`, `scheduler.py`, etc.) and concatenates them into a single list. This list is then used by the `bench` runner to build the full CLI structure.
-   **`pass_context`**: This is a custom decorator that wraps almost all command functions. Its primary job is to initialize the Frappe context for the specified site (`frappe.init(site)`) before the command logic runs, and to tear it down afterwards (`frappe.destroy()`). This ensures that API calls like `frappe.db.get_value` or `frappe.get_doc` work correctly within the command. It also provides error handling and optional code profiling.

### `site.py`

This is arguably the most critical file for instance management. It contains the logic for creating, modifying, and deleting sites.

-   **`new_site`**: A complex function that orchestrates the entire site creation process. It calls `frappe.installer._new_site`, which handles creating the database, setting the admin password, installing specified apps, and optionally populating the database from a SQL file.
-   **`restore`**: Manages restoring a site from a backup. It includes logic to detect and decrypt encrypted backups before passing the SQL file to the installer logic. It can also restore public and private files if they are provided as tarballs.
-   **`migrate`**: The workhorse of updates. It calls `frappe.migrate.SiteMigration`, which is a class that systematically runs patches, synchronizes the database schema with DocType definitions, and rebuilds various assets like CSS and JS files.
-   **`backup`**: Wraps the `frappe.utils.backups.scheduled_backup` function, providing a CLI interface to create full or partial backups of the database and files.
-   Other commands like `install-app`, `uninstall-app`, and `drop-site` provide essential administrative functions for managing the applications and lifecycle of a site.

### `scheduler.py`

This file provides the CLI for managing Frappe's background processing system, which is based on Python RQ (Redis Queue).

-   **`enable_scheduler` / `disable_scheduler`**: These commands set a flag in the database (`Scheduled Job Type`) that the scheduler process checks periodically. This allows administrators to globally start or stop the enqueueing of new jobs.
-   **`scheduler`**: A newer, more versatile command that can also pause the scheduler (by writing to `site_config.json`) without disabling it entirely, which is useful for temporary maintenance.
-   **`doctor` / `show-pending-jobs`**: These are diagnostic tools that connect to Redis and inspect the queues to show the status of workers and the number of pending jobs, which is essential for troubleshooting background job issues.
-   **`start_scheduler` / `start_worker`**: These are the functions that, when called, start the long-running processes for the scheduler and workers. They are not meant to be run manually for every task but are intended to be managed by a process supervisor like `systemd` or `supervisor`.

### `utils.py`

This file is a collection of miscellaneous but important commands, mostly geared towards development and data management.

-   **`build` / `watch`**: These commands are central to front-end development. They invoke Frappe's build tool (`frappe.build`), which uses `esbuild` to compile JavaScript and CSS assets from source files into optimized bundles for the browser.
-   **`console`**: A highly valuable debugging tool. It starts an interactive IPython session with a fully initialized Frappe context, allowing developers to run any framework API call, inspect data, and test logic interactively.
-   **`serve`**: Starts the Werkzeug development web server, which is used for local development.
-   **Data Import/Export (`export-json`, `import-doc`, etc.)**: Provides CLI access to Frappe's data import/export tools, allowing for scripting of data migration and manipulation tasks.
