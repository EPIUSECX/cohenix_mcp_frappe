# Model Context Profile: `data`

## 1. Module Overview

The `data` module is not a functional module containing Python logic. It serves as a simple repository for static data files that are used by the framework.

The primary purpose of this module is to store data sets that are required for certain features, but which are not large or complex enough to warrant their own DocType or more complex management.

## 2. File Index

-   **`google_fonts.json`**: A JSON file containing a list of Google Font names. This list is used to populate font selection dropdowns in features like Print Format Builder and Website Theme.

## 3. Public API / Callable Functions

This module does not contain any callable functions or a public API.

## 4. Detailed Walkthrough

As this is a content-only module, there are no code files to analyze. The module's function is to provide a centralized location for static data assets.
