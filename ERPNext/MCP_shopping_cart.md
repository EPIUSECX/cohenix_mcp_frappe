# Model Context Profile: Shopping Cart

## 1. Module Overview

The `shopping_cart` module in ERPNext is a configuration-focused module that provides the settings and basic structure for the e-commerce and web portal shopping cart functionality. It is not a standalone functional module but rather a component that plugs into the broader `Website` and `E Commerce` functionalities provided by the Frappe framework and the `erpnext` app.

This module itself contains no significant business logic or transactional DocTypes. Its primary contribution is the `Shopping Cart Settings` DocType, which allows administrators to configure the behavior and appearance of the web store.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. `Shopping Cart Settings` DocType

This is the central and only significant component of the module. It is a singleton DocType that holds all the global configurations for the shopping cart.

-   **Key Features**:
    -   **Enabled/Disabled**: A simple checkbox to enable or disable the shopping cart feature entirely.
    -   **Company**: Links the shopping cart settings to a specific `Company`.
    -   **Price List**: Specifies the default `Price List` to be used for all website items.
    -   **Default Customer Group**: Defines the `Customer Group` to which new customers signing up via the website will be assigned.
    -   **Quotation Series**: Sets the naming series for `Quotations` created from the shopping cart.
    -   **Payment Gateway**: Links to a `Payment Gateway Account` to process online payments.

### 2.2. Web Templates (`web_template/`)

This directory is intended to hold web templates related to the shopping cart, such as product listings, cart views, and checkout pages. However, in the standard ERPNext application, most of these templates are located in the `erpnext.e_commerce` app or the core `frappe.website` module. This directory in the `shopping_cart` module serves as a placeholder for custom templates or extensions.

## 3. Data Flow and Architecture

The `shopping_cart` module itself does not have a complex data flow. Instead, it provides the configuration that governs the data flow within the broader e-commerce system.

1.  A **Website User** browses the website, which displays items based on the `Website Item` master.
2.  The prices displayed are determined by the **`Default Price List`** set in **`Shopping Cart Settings`**.
3.  When a user adds items to their cart, a temporary cart object is managed in the user's session.
4.  During checkout, the system uses the settings from **`Shopping Cart Settings`** to:
    -   Create a **`Customer`** record for the user if one does not exist, assigning them to the **`Default Customer Group`**.
    -   Create a **`Quotation`** (or a `Sales Order`, depending on the configuration) using the specified **`Quotation Series`**.
    -   Redirect the user to the configured **`Payment Gateway`** to complete the payment.

## 4. Architectural Significance

The `shopping_cart` module is an example of how ERPNext uses dedicated singleton DocTypes to manage the configuration of specific features. By centralizing all shopping cart-related settings in one place, it provides a simple and intuitive way for administrators to manage their e-commerce store without needing to modify code.

Architecturally, it demonstrates the "pluggable" nature of ERPNext features. The core shopping cart logic resides elsewhere, and this module simply provides the necessary configuration and extension points (like web templates) to customize its behavior for a specific implementation. This separation of concerns makes the system more maintainable and easier to extend.

## 5. Callable Functions (`@frappe.whitelist()`)

This module has **no whitelisted functions**. It is a configuration module and does not expose any callable API methods.
